// Create an array of strings, each one related to a topic that interests me

var topics = ["hack", "raspberry pi", "wifi", "3dprinting"]

// Save the array to a variable called 'topics'

//Take the topics in the array and create buttons in the HTML
	//Consider using a loop that appends a button for each string in the array

//When user clicks a button, page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the 
//Giphy api and place them on the page.

//When user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the GIF should animate.
//If user clicks again, the animation should stop.

//Display rating under every GIF (rating provided by API)

//Include form on page that takes user input box and adds it to the topics array.
//Then make a function call that adds each topic as a button option.
